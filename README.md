This object needs `MuseSounds` developed by Muse Group. Download it from https://www.musehub.com/ and for Linux search for Muse Sounds Manager (bottom of the page).

As they say: 

> Muse Sounds cover the symphony orchestra and choral voices. Incredibly, these beautifully crafted instrument packs are available exclusively in Muse Hub completely **free**.â€‹

I hope that this can be used for Live-Eletronics music. Or just for fun!
